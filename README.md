# C Library - Russell's personal C standard library

## WARNING

While this project is MIT Licensed, I do not recommend using it.
The APIs are unstable and incomplete, and I do not plan on marking them
stable until I am 100% happy with them.

## About the Project

Are you writing C but you're tired of implementing linked lists?
Don't want to use C++ templates or crazy C macros for generic data structures?
Just generate them! Easy generic data structures without the mess!

## How to Run

Run:
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Then run:
```bash
$ ./generate --help
```
to print the help info.
